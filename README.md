### ‚ùìWhat is Libft?:
Libft is the first project of the 42 Core Program. It aims to get students to create a library of functions that can be used in any C project, and also servers as revision of programming concepts covered in the the 1-month Piscine coding bootcamp, prior to the core program

### üìñ Main concepts covered
- Recap on the basics of C: E.g. Functions, pointers, memory allocation etc.
- Newer concepts such as Header files and linking, makefile and compiling into libraries, linked-lists

### My experience with the Libft
Overall, Libft was fairly straightforward. It was like doing a series of small puzzles, a few of which were more difficult than others.
The main dilemma I had while working on this project was figuring out how much complex functions should rely on others. For example, some of the more complex functions, such as ... may depend on smaller more basic functions that were already part of the library.

My final decision was to keep it simple and have functional interdependance when nescessary. I realised that I would likely require using these functions alongside each other, under the compiled library of libft, so it wasn't nescessary to segregate functions.
